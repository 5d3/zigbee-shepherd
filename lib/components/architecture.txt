In this library, we need:

1. shepherd: device box
2. shepherd: endpoint box
3. database to store devices and endpoints

4. Coordinator class <-> it's a controller, distingushed from a remote device
    >> ccznp is the interface to coord
    >> Zdo class <-> does not expose, integreated with Coordinator <-> inherit
    >> sys methods
    >> nwk methods
6. Device class
7. Endpoint class -> like a Gadget, it's the major player
   -> foundation methods

8. Cluster class -> does not expose, attributes should be gathered (really needs a class? or is that ok with a data object) -> Many attribute objects


notes:

1. cluster -> functional operations
2. read/write?

function ZShepherd(coord) {
    this._devbox = new ObjectBox();
    this._epbox = new ObjectBox();
    this.controller = coord;

    this._net = {       // get from controller
        panId: null,
        extPanId: null,
        address: {
            ieee: '',
            nwk: ''
        }
    };
}
