In this libray, we need:

1. device box
2. endpoint box
3. database to store devices and endpoints

4. Coordinator class <-> it's a controller, distingushed from a remote device
    >> ccznp is the interface to coord
    >> Zdo class <-> does not expose, integreated with Coordinator
6. Device class
7. Endpoint class -> like a Gadget, it's the major player
8. Cluster class -> does not expose, attributes should be gathered (really needs a class? or is that ok with a data object)


notes:

1. cluster -> functional operations
2. read/write?

function ZShepherd(coord) {
    this.panId = undefined;
    this.extPanId = undefined;
}
